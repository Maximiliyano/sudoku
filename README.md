# Sudoku

Given a Sudoku data structure with size NxN, N > 1 and √N == integer, write a method to validate if it has been filled out correctly.
The data structure is a multi-dimensional Array (in Rust: Vec<Vec<int>>), i.e. for example Sudoku with size 9x9:

Rules for validation:
●	Data structure dimension: NxN where N > 1 and √N == integer
●	‘Small squares’ (3x3 in example above) should be √Nx√N
●	A number in multi-dimensional array may only appear once in a single row, column or in the ‘Small square’
